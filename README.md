## Game background and rules introduction:

Akio, who lives in the peaceful Republic, likes to learn digging techniques. He leads a comfortable life every day. Suddenly one day, a group of monsters jumped out of a crack in the ground and started capturing young girls from the village. Akio's girlfriend was also captured! These villains want to dominate the underground world. In order to rescue his beloved girlfriend, Akio takes out his drill and sets off on a journey! Sell the mined minerals, and the Doctor will provide some items and upgrade equipment. Head to the depths of the underground and battle the monster clan to save your girlfriend. 

__Control keys__:

 	'w' fly up;
 	's' dig down if there is a block below the character;
 	'a' move left if there is no block to the left, otherwise dig left;
 	'd' move right if there is no block to the right, otherwise dig right;
 	'j' place a bomb;
 	'k' use an energy pack to increase energy;
 	'l' use an oxygen pack to increase oxygen

__Shop Operations__: 

	Press '1' to buy a bomb for 500;
	Press '2' to upgrade energy level;
	Press '3' to upgrade oxygen level;
	Press '4' to buy an oxygen pack;
	Press '5' to buy an energy pack.

## Game Goal

	Continuously mine minerals and use the money earned from selling them to upgrade items and defeat three villains.

__Rules for Digging Boy__:

	Initial economy of 500 score;
	Score will automatically increase;
	Use score to upgrade and buy equipment;
	Flying up requires energy consumption;
	Being underground requires oxygen consumption;
	Running underground will accelerate oxygen consumption;
	Running on the ground will accelerate energy and oxygen recovery;
	All actions of the character will slow down in level 2;
	Coming into contact with monsters will decrease oxygen;
	Bombs will kill monsters and also injure the character.

__Hidden benefit__:

	Coal blocks have regenerative abilities as long as you don't destroy their source (picking up a coal block and not digging it for a few seconds before it regenerates will cause it to automatically recover).
